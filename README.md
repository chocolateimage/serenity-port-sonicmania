## Installation
You need [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) compiled first.  

Download this [repo](https://github.com/chocolateimage/serenity-port-sonicmania/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) then copy the folder into the "Ports" directory.  

Run `./package.sh` while in the Sonic Mania port folder.

Buy the game from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/584400/Sonic_Mania/) (if you haven't already) then copy "Data.rsdk" over to "serenity/Build/x86_64/Root/home/anon/.config/sonicmania/"
